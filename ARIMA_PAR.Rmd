# Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis is to use ARIMA models to find if Photosynthetic Active Radiation is a more suitable explanatory variable to Net Ecosystem Exchange than salinity to forecast future Net Ecosystem Exchange of a scrub mangrove forest.

# Methods
## Site Information 
TS/PH 7 is located 25.19080491, -80.63910514 up Taylor River mainly characterized by scrub mangrove vegetation of the -Rhizophora mangle- species. This is an established FCE LTER site within the Taylor Slough Watershed.

## Statistical Analysis
 Photosynthetic Active Radiation (par; W m−2 day−1)  will be incorporated to the forecast function of the ARIMA model after the temporal dynamics of NEE were adquired. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test will be used to test stationarity. Ljung-Box test will test for independece and finally the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) of the model outputs will be compared to test for model fitness.

Model | df | AIC
--- | --- | --- |
arima.nee2 | 18 | 704.7663
arima.nee5 | 10 | 683.6937
arima.nee4 | 9 | 700.7734


# Discussion 

Photosynthetic Active Radiation seems to be a better explanatory series of nee than salinity with a lower AIC as you can see in table 1.
