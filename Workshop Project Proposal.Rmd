## Research Statement
Mangrove forests act as an essential nutrient cycling ecosystem in tropical and subtropical coastal areas. The productivity of this ecological function has been decreasing as forests are both naturally and anthropogenically disturbed, subsequently affecting the current global mangrove cover. Although several conservation and restoration initiatives have successfully restored or conserved existing forests, the already urbanized areas that replaced historical mangroves are lacking vegetation that can provide any nutrient cycling, thus nutrients in urban coastal areas are more likely to contaminate coastal waters. Mangrove deforestation and coastal eutrophication due to anthropogenic activity can pontentially be ammended by introducing Mangrove Urban Ecological Infrastructure (UEI) combined with a flow-through flume structure to the shoreline. This UEI set up will allow for enclosed sampling in order to obtain nutrient ratios within a known volume in situ. However, before a mangrove UEI is implemented, the nutrient fluxes of the shoreline need to be temporally and spatially measured to significanly represent the area's average nutrient levels.

## Objectives
1. To calculate AGM of TN, TP, and TOC/DOC of the targeted urban coastal area using DERM Water Quality data 1988-2013
2. To spacially distribute nutrient fluxes using DERM WQ sampling well data. 
3. To project nutrient fluxes for the next 5 years with and without mangrove ecosystem services.
