# Objectives
The primary objective of this analysis is to run a Species Distribution Model (SDM) using the bioclim approach to geographically visualize where *Carnegiea gigantea* is expected to occur.

# Methods
## Species Information 
*Carnegiea gigantea* is a large columnar cactus essential to the Sonora Desert, with most of its population established in Sonora, Mexico (Alburquerque *et al.,* 2018).  

## Statistical Analysis
Using latitude and longitude coordinates where *Carnegiea gigantea* has been observed and abiotic data obtained from WorldClim a bioclim model was fit. Random pseudo-absence points were used to fit the model, as it has been observed to be the most reliable approach for distribution models (Barber-Massin *et al.* 2012). Table 1 shows how there's even representation for each group.

# Discussion (1 paragrapgh)
According to the generated map, *Carnegiea gigantea* is expected to shift towards the northern area of the Sonora Desert, located in California and Arizona. The bioclim model using pseudo-absent random points approach to incorporate more range to the existing present data, may be a useful method to monitor species distribution as climate change effects are causing ecosystems to transition to more suitable areas.
